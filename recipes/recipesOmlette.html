        <ul>
            <li> 2-3 eggs, thoroughly beaten</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li> A pinch of pepper</li>
            <li> 1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li> Any combination of vegetables, cheeses, and/or meats that you like (I enjoy mushrooms, cheddar, and bacon)</li>

        <h2> How to use it </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a medium bowl, beat the eggs along with the milk, salt, and pepper</li>
            <li> Heat a skillet on medium-high heat and add oil to coat the bottom evenly</li>
            <li> Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li> Gently, trying to avoid tearing the eggs, lift the cooked eggs up and let the still raw eggs flow underneath</li>
            <li> Add any meat, cheeses, or vegetables you want to one half of the cooked eggs</li>
            <li> Turn the heat to medium-low, lace a lid on the skillet and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li> If firm enough, fold the omlette in half and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the outside is just starting to darken</li>
            <li> It's okay if the inside is still soft when you are done, it will continue to cook for another few minutes after you take it off the heat</li> 
        </ol>
